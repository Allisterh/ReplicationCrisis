This repository contains code that create a dataset of global stock returns and characteristics. The dataset was created for the paper _Is There a Replication Crisis in Finance?_ by Jensen, Kelly and Pedersen (2021). Please cite this paper if you are using the code or data.

.sas files construct the stock-level characteristics and factor portfolio returns for all countries via direct link to WRDS.  Documentation.pdf provides detailed descriptions of the code and all data construction choices.  chars.xlsx lists the 153 factors (and their original sources, directional bets, and significance in the original paper) studied in Jensen, Kelly and Pedersen (2021), which is a subset of the factors/characteristics generated by this code.
